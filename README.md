# Interactive-3D-Story-Creator

### Tasks to be addressed:
- Add animation to scrollable text (with options to select direction from where it appears, color, font, size, scaling view turning into background, etc.)
- Implement ability to load/import a spreadsheet containing text, frame number, and duration for how long the scrollable text remains visible in frames. This feature will help save time rather than writing/pasting in the editor journalists/users will be able to load their text instantly.
- Add possibility of loading custom path for camera.
- Add possibility to make also change of slides based on click event (left/right and corresponding jump between camera points A and B, etc).
